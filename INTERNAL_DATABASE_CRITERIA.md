For the verification info of an app from a source to be added to the internal verification info database,
the source must be listed on the app's website or repository as an official way to get the app.

AppVerifier is used (with "Show hasMultipleSigners" on in Settings to visually verify that) to verify
the validity of the submitted verification info to be included in the internal database.
