## Download

AppVerifier is available on the [Accrescent](https://accrescent.app) app store and GitHub releases. [Accrescent](https://accrescent.app) is the recommended way to get AppVerifier as it is more secure than GitHub releases.

The package name and SHA-256 hash of the signing certificate is below, so you can verify AppVerifier with [apksigner](https://developer.android.com/studio/command-line/apksigner#usage-verify) verify --print-certs if you are downloading the apk. If you are downloading from [Accrescent](https://accrescent.app) then you should verify [Accrescent](https://accrescent.app) itself [here](https://accrescent.app/faq#verifying).

It can also be found on a [Bluesky post](https://bsky.app/profile/soupslurpr.dev/post/3khnczlribj2i) to distrust the website. It is encouraged to verify it's the same with other people as well for assurance.
