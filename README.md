# AppVerifier

AppVerifier is an app signing certificate hash viewer and verifier.\
It enables you to easily verify your apps with others!

AppVerifier includes a database for verifying apps.\
If an app isn't on the internal database yet, you can simply share the verification info to others and receive verification info from them and
share the received verification info to AppVerifier and you will see the verification status.\
AppVerifier does the heavy lifting for you ðŸ’ª

Check CONTRIBUTING.md if you'd like to contribute to the internal database.

## Download

AppVerifier is available on the [Accrescent](https://accrescent.app) app store and GitHub releases. [Accrescent](https://accrescent.app) is the recommended way to get AppVerifier as it is more secure than GitHub releases.\

The package name and SHA-256 hash of the signing certificate is below, so you can verify AppVerifier with [apksigner](https://developer.android.com/studio/command-line/apksigner#usage-verify) verify --print-certs if you are downloading the apk. If you are downloading from [Accrescent](https://accrescent.app) then you should verify [Accrescent](https://accrescent.app) itself [here](https://accrescent.app/faq#verifying).

## Branding

You may not use the name "AppVerifier", a name that includes "AppVerifier", and the app icon in a derivative work that has published builds.\
This is to prevent confusion of which is the official AppVerifier.
